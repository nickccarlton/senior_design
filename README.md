Because current guitar pedals are expensive, inflexible, or difficult-to-adjust in real-time, we are developing a *low-cost guitar pedal with modular I/O/controls panels and reconfigurable core*.

The code here performs three general tasks:
1) Integrates our modular I/O panels;
2) Integrates our modular controls panels; and
3) Digitally processes input audio stream(s) to produce acoustically pleasing processed signal(s).
